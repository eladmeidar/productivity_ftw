h1. Producivity FTW!

Tired of wasting your time on useless crap like facebook/twitter/other-time-consuming-no-profit-website? well *productivity_ftw* is just for you.

h2. Installing 

just checkout the source:
<pre>git clone git://github.com/eladmeidar/productivity_ftw.git</pre>

and fire off the productivity enhancing server:
<pre>
sudo ruby productivity_ftw.rb
</pre>

(you'll probably need to install the bjeanes-ghost gem first)

note that you *have to use sudo* cause you are taking over port 80, not sure if it's required on windows also.

h2. Adding more hosts to block

To create your own blocklist, create a <tt>~/.productivity_ftwrc</tt> file in your home directory. See <tt>productivity_ftwrc.sample</tt> for an example of the right format.

h2. Overriding the productive page

Not everyone likes Rick Astley! That's okay.

Step 1: Click <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLsJryWc5XE">here</a> for a quick overview on the internal architecture.

Step 2: Create a <tt>~/.productivity_ftw_page</tt> file in your home directory. See the default <tt>pages/productive_page</tt>.

h2. "Thank you"s
