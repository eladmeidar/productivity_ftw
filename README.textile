h1. Producivity FTW!

Tired of wasting your time on useless crap like facebook/twitter/other-time-consuming-no-profit-website? well *productivity_ftw* is just for you.

h2. Installing 

just checkout the source:
<pre>git clone git://github.com/eladmeidar/productivity_ftw.git</pre>

and fire off the productivity enhancing server:
<pre>
sudo ruby productivity_ftw.rb
</pre>

note that you *have to use sudo* cause you are taking over port 80, not sure if it's required on windows also.

h2. Adding more hosts to block

open the <code>b-productive.rb</code> file and add to the <code>BLOCK_LIST</code> host array, a better solution is welcome, i am just lazy.

h2. "Thank you"s
